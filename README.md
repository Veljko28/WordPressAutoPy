# WordPressAutoPy
Automates WordPress Products using Python 3 and Selenium. 

Using Selenium fetches information from a given website, takes the image and resizes it. Goes to WordPress and duplicates the last product and edits it with the new information. 
Uploads the new image and creates the post. It can take a list of products (their HREFS) and create individual WordPress product pages. With some ajustments can be used to get data
from any website.
